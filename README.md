# TodoMVC copy
This is a school assignment in our frontend-class, it's a ToDo list that is made to closely resemble [the famous TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/examples/backbone/).
The website has a responsive design and is made using HTML, CSS and TypeScript. We've also incorporated use of local storage to store todos for the user.
Tests for this project were written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
